# Purpose

The United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) website is a wonderful site that has all of the information that one seeking such information could want.  It is, however, a "busy" website.  For those who just want to study the questions associated with the civics test portion of the citizenship process, this app is for you.

There is no requirement to create a profile or log in.  There are nine question and answer/quiz couplets that enable one to study a specific set of questions, not the hundred plus questions as listed on the USCIS website.

The quiz functionality is simple: 1) click the button to randomly select a question, 2) answer the question 3) submit the question.  That's it!.  When all the questions have been answered, a display tabulating the results will appear.  The current official test requires a 60% success rate to pass the civics test, so that is what I have done as well.  It appears as though that success rate will change in the near future.  That is why I advise everyone to visit the USCIS official site to check for potential updates to questions, answers, passing scores, etc.

Good Luck!
